## Learning Goals
    - Learn to manipulate python
    - Creating Python functions
    - Structuring data
    - Creating algorithms

## Setup/Installation Requirements
    - Clone or download zip located in the code section of the github repository into your desired folder on your device. 
    - Extract the files
    - Open the folder with vs code.
    - In the terminal run pipenv install & pipenv shell to get the neccesary dependencies & python files installed.
    - Your application is running! Ready to go!

## Instructions
    - In the same files or different scripts code out the following functions, push to a github repo and submit it for grading. 

### QUESTION 1 (STACKS):
    Implement a function is_balanced(expression) that takes a string 
    containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets,and determines whether 
    the expression is balanced. 

    An expression is considered balanced if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing 
    bracket in the correct order.

    sample input = 

    expression1 = "([]{})"
    expression2 = "([)]"
    print(is_balanced(expression1))  # Output: True
    print(is_balanced(expression2))  # Output: False 

### QUESTION 2 (LISTS/TUPLES): 
    Write a function remove_duplicates(sequence) that takes a 
    sequence (list or tuple) and returns a new sequence with duplicates 
    removed while maintaining the original order of elements. 

    sample input = 

    input_sequence = [2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 5]
    result = remove_duplicates(input_sequence)
    print(result)  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

 ### QUESTION 3 (DICTIONARIES): 
    Implement a function word_frequency(sentence) that takes 
    a sentence and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each 
    word in the sentence. 

    Ignore punctuation and consider words in a case-insensitive manner. 

    sample input = 

    sentence = "This is a test sentence. This sentence is a test."
    result = word_frequency(sentence)
    print(result)
